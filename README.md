# CPSC 481 â€“ T08-4
Completed by: Kolby Lalonde, Jessica LI and Sunny Hoang

## Welcome to **GenLink!**

In this CPSC 481 design project, we are a startup team with the goal of creating a mobile app that connects grandchildren with their remote grandparents. The application is designed specifically for three user groups: **parents** (as administrators), **children**, and **grandparents**. Our aim is to streamline remote connection for families and reduce the frustration often experienced with current communication tools. This document outlines key points to help you navigate and set up the system.

## Key Notes

- **Screen Dimensions:**  
  The system was designed specifically for the **iPhone SE** screen size (**375x667** pixels). We recommend using **Google Chrome** and setting your viewport to these dimensions to view the screens as intended. In a final product release, all components would be expected to scale appropriately for different screen sizes.

- **Family Join Codes:**
  - To access the main family group containing all current functionality use the code: **"123"**
  - To access the secondary family group displaying user restrictions through tab hiding use the code: **"abc"**
  - Note that newly created family groups will not be assecible with the join code. (Proof of concept design)

## Getting Started

To view the interface as intended:

1. Open **Google Chrome**.
2. Open **Developer Tools** (Right-click > Inspect or press `Cmd+Option+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3. Toggle **device toolbar** (icon that looks like a phone/tablet or press `Cmd+Shift+M` / `Ctrl+Shift+M`).
4. Set the screen size to **375 x 667** (iPhone SE).
5. Start the project through a live server from the page: **CPSC481T08-4/JoinPage/JoinPage.html**.

## Project Goals

- Encourage and support long-distance family interaction.
- Provide an intuitive and low-friction UI for all age groups.
- Offer simple administrative controls for parents (Admin users).
